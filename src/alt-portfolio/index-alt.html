				<h2>About-Me</h2>
				<p>
					Sorev provides full stack service for the creation of courses and other forms of digital
goods for creators. Our aim is to relieve the time and effort it takes to get your courses
and products into the hands of your fans and for you to make smooth, easy, recurring
revenue.
Sorev works with your schedule to create a course through scripting, pre-production and
planning, video production, editing, marketing, and managing your course or other digital goods.
It is so important to us for you, the creator, to live a well balanced life, and we can work with you
to fit our service into any schedule or time frame.
Our services are completely free of upfront charge for the creator. Even the paid ads are free!
To do this Sorev and the creator will enter into an agreement to split the profits of the course,
product, or subscription produced by the agreement. Sorev provides the heavy lifting of aid in
the design, creation of the materials, management, sales, and marketing, while the creator
provides their talent and likeness.
